# Ski passes

### Buy the season pass before last of November

* *Le pass*: Most of Chamonix
* *Unilmited*: Aiguille du Midi, Grand montets top, Les Houches, Megeve and a few days in other resorts like Verbier 

If you think that you will come back anything in the summer then it's probably worth getting the yearly pass
